## Easy Installed
+ The Rotation direction of motor was marked on the from bell,making it easier to determine rotation direction for CW and CCW motors.

## Strong Thrust Power
+ Produces over +1,000g of thrust using 4S and GF5045BN, is more stronger than other ordinary 2205 brushless motor.

## Well Capability
+ High N52 Magnets, the highest grade magnets, which is better acceleration, stopping power, and sustained RPMs during high kv.
	
## High Quality Guarantee
+ The new standard of EMAX RS2205 2600KV brushless motor is upgraded with features racing multirotors absolutely need. The motor is lighter, yields faster bell rotational response, higher thrust.
