      <p>Tiny Whoop is a small first-person-view aircraft that truly allows you to feel the gift of flight and the feeling of being tiny. A small apartment becomes a vast terrain worthy of taming. The small tree in your front yard is a deep and engaging forrest. With shrouded propellers we can now fly FPV around people and kids safely. It's more fun than I've ever had. </p>
