        <h3>Binding & Flying Procedure</h3>
        <p> To bind the Makerfire Micro FPV Drone to a Spektrum radio:</p>
        <p>a.Click the bind-button meanwhile powering on the drone, either by connecting the battery or USB power. Then the receiver will enter bind mode, indicated by rapid blue receiver  LED flashing.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/dsmx-bind-button.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>b.Now, on the radio, hold the bind-button while powering on the radio (or what it takes to enter bind-mode).</p>
        <p>c.The red light on the XRACER should stop blinking when the bind is completed.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/dsmx-bind-demo.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>d.<strong>Only need to bind the radio ONCE.</strong>Next time the receiver will bind to the last radio automatically.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If you have problems binding change the TX to DSM2/22ms mode. Normally what you set on the TX is the desired mode and the TX+RX negotiate their capabilities and select a mutually compatible mode. The receiver in this quad seems unable to do that reliably.</p>
        <p>If you still have problems binding take the TX and walk to the other side of the room. This is a solution that Spektrum themselves recommend for some TX+RX firmware combinations. This seems to be the case between my DX8 and this quad.</p>

        <h3>Betaflight/Cleanflight GUI Set Up</h3>
        <p>The flight controller board comes pre-flashed with BetaFlight and proper settings for the Makerfire FPV Micro Drone already set up but you still need to configure the receiver settings. Also if you upgrade the firmware or reset settings, you will lose the receiver settings and need to set them up again.</p>

        <p>CLI Tab:</p>
        <p>Go to CLI and type this in.</p>
        <pre>set motor_pwm_rate=10000
save</pre>

        <p>Configuration Tab:</p>
        <p>ESC/Motor Features,ESC/Motor protocol,click and select <strong>BRUSHED</strong>,switch on MOTOR_STOP(optional).</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-gui-11.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive">

        <p>Receiver Mode, choose RX_PPM;Serial Receiver Provider, choose SPEKTRUM1024.And click the Save and Reboot button in the lower right corner.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The receiver is NOT serial.It outputs PPM signal.</p>
        <p>The receiver does not follow the Spektrum channel mapping. Instead it outputs AERT1234.</p>

        <p>Due to the overwhelming response from the customers, we have put together this FAQ to answer the most commonly asked questions.This section will grow as more and more customers give us valuable feeedback and suggestions on how to improve the tuning.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can I enjoy it if i am a drone hobby beginner?</p>
        <p>This is not a beginners quad.You will need a decent transmitter.</p>
        <p>You will need to know how to use the program cleanflight/betaflight.</p>
        <p>Most importantly,you should have 5.8G goggles to enjoy the FPV experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Is this a complete rtf quad and does it include a battery?</p>
        <p>This is not complete RTF drone. You will need a transmitter to bind to it. Spektrum DX8 is recommended.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>I want more information about the brush flight controller.</p>
        <p>Makerfire F3 brushed flight controller with Native DSM receiver, support DSM2 protocol with 8 channel or above for this current version, compatible with Spektrum DX8, DX9, DX10, DX18, DX20 transmitter, would be upgrade for supporting all Spektrum radio transmitter, like DX6/DX6i.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What Flight Modes does it have?</p>
        <p>The board runs the popular Cleanflight/Betaflight firmware that is fully customizable and includes several different modes: Auto-Level, Horizon (auto-leveling mode with ability to flip), and full manual (rate). You can also enable AirMode and be able to control the quad at any speed and attitude!</p>
